# Instructions

## Assignments 1 - 9
Assignments from 1 to 9 were done with Linux and can be ran with Linux. I used CLion to do the assignments. They should be able to be compiled with CMAKE, but the specific command for this I'm unaware of (CLion makes this automatically).

These assignments are available in the [Assignments_1-10_Linux folder](./Assignments_1-10_Linux/).

You can just copy the source code to Visual Studio in Windows if you don't have Linux and/or CMAKE available.

## Assignment 10
This is a Windows project done with Visual Studio. You can run the .exe file in Assignment10/Debug to run the solution, or you can build it yourself from the sources. Visual Studio should be able to do this.

This assignment is available in [Assignment10 folder](./Assignment10/).
